    <section><h1>What is Programming</h1>

      <p>Programming is the art of telling a machine what to do. Most
      machines do only one thing: a vacuum cleaner picks up dirt; a
      refrigerator keeps food cold, etc.</p>

      <p>Many machines can accept simple instructions. We can set a
      thermostat to tell the air conditioner how cold to keep the room. We
      step on the gas pedal to make a car move faster. We can even control
      how much a hammer moves a nail by adjusting how hard we swing our
      arm.</p>

      <p>Computers are a special kind of machine designed so that we can
      control them much more. We can give a computer a long set of
      instructions, and we can even ask it to make
      decisions.</p>

      <p><dfn>Programming</dfn> is the art of giving these
      instructions to a computer. Webol is a special program I've written to
      teach you how to program. It starts with a few simple steps and will
      add more and more, as you get more advanced.</p>

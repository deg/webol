      <h1>Introduction to Programming with Webol</h1>

    <section><h1>What is Programming</h1>

      <p>Programming is the art of telling a machine what to do. Most
      machines do only one thing: a vacuum cleaner picks up dirt; a
      refrigerator keeps food cold, etc.</p>

      <p>Many machines can accept simple instructions. We can set the
      thermostat to tell the air conditioner how cold to keep the food. We
      step on the gas pedal to make a car move faster. We can even control
      how much a hammer moves a nail by adjusting how hard we swing our
      arm.</p>

      <p>Computers are a special kind of machine designed so that we can
      control them much more. We can give a computer a long set of
      instructions, and we can even ask it to make
      decisions.</p>

      <p><dfn>Programming</dfn> is the art of giving these
      instructions to a computer. Webol is a special program I've written to
      teach you how to program. It starts with a few simple steps and will
      add more and more, as you get more advanced.</p>

    </section>

    <section><h1>Immediate Commands</h1>

      <p>The first thing we will in Webol is how to tell the computer to do
      something right now. This is called an <dfn>immediate mode</dfn>
      commands. One such command, which we will learn very soon, is
      the <code>PRINT</code> command which tells the computer to write
      something.</p>

      <h2>The Webol console</h2>

      <p>But, first, we need to learn about the <dfn>Webol console</dfn>. You
      should open the console now, in a different window or tab, by going to
      <a href="http://webol.degel.com">the Webol web page</a>.</p>

      <p>This page includes several sections, most of which will only be
      important later on.</p>

      <p>For now, look for the section that says
      <code>"Cmd:"</code>. We call this part of the screen the <dfn>input
      line</dfn>. This is where you will type commands to the computer.</p>

      <p>The big box on top of this is called the <dfn>console</dfn>. It is
      where the computer will display its answers.</p>

      <h2>The <code>PRINT</code> Command</h2>

      <p>The first command we will learn is the <code>PRINT</code>
      command. This tells the computer to "say" something. We can tell it to
      print a number, or a message. We can even solve arithmetic.</p>

      <p>To give a command, you need to type it, followed by
      the <code>enter</code> key. Each time you do this, the computer will
      repeat your command in the console, and then show its answer.</p>

      <p>Try the following:</p>

      <p><kbd>PRINT "Hello"</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT 3</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT 3+7</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT "3+7"</kbd></p>

      <p class="question">Question: What did the computer answer to each of
      these commands?  What was different about the last two commands?  What
      do you think the quotation marks mean in the print commmand?</p>

      <p class="question">Question: what do you think will happen if
      type <kbd>PRINT hello</kbd> to the computer? Try it now.</p>

    </section>

    <section><h1>Run Mode</h1>

      <p>In immediate mode, the computer does exactly what you ask, and does
      it immediately. This is very nice if you want to use the computer as a
      calculator, but sometimes you want to do more: You want to give the
      computer a set of instructions for it to run later on, or maybe to run
      many times.</p>

      <p>To do this, you need to write a <dfn>program</dfn>. There are many,
      many different programming languages. Some were designed to make
      certain jobs easier. Others were designed for teaching. Still others
      were created because ... well, I don't know; people just like
      inventing new things.</p>

      <p>Webol uses a small programming language that I have designed for
      teaching students. It is very similar to the first language I learned,
      called BASIC, which was created at Dartmouth University almost fifty
      years ago.</p>

      <h2>Line numbers</h2>

      <p>In Webol, you create a program by writing commands that start with
      a <dfn>line number</dfn>. Here is a simple program:</p>

      <blockquote>
	1 PRINT "Hello!"<br>
	2 PRINT "My name is Webby."<br>
	3 PRINT "I am a program."<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Try typing that program into the Webol console. Notice that the
      computer echoes each line back to you, but does not actually run the
      line. You have now written a program: a set of instructions that the
      computer can follow.</p>

      <h2>Commands that manage programs</h2>

      <h3>The <code>LIST</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>LIST</code> command tells the computer to show us the
      whole program.</p>

      <p>Try it now:<br>
      <kbd>LIST</kbd></p>

      <h3>The <code>RUN</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>RUN</code> command tells the computer to run the
      program. It will look for all the instructions we gave, and will run
      them, in the order of the line numbers.</p>

      <h3>The <code>CLEAR</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>CLEAR</code> command tells the computer to forget all the
      lines that we taught it. After you say <kbd>CLEAR</kbd>, the computer
      will not have a program to run until you give it a new program.</p>

      <h2>Controlling program flow</h2>

      <p><dfn>Program flow</dfn> means the order in which the computer
      follows instructions. Like we saw above, normally Webol starts with
      the lowest line number, and runs each instruction exactly once. This
      lets us do many things. For example:

      <p class="question">Write a program that counts from one to five. (You
      should be able to write this program in just five instructions).</p>

      <p class="question">Run the program to make sure that it works.</p>

      <p>In the next lesson, we will learn two new
      commands, <code>GOTO</code> and <code>IF</code>, that will let us
      write programs that are much more interesting.</p>

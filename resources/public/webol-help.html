    <section><h1>What is Programming</h1>

      <p>Programming is the art of telling a machine what to do. Most machines
      do only one thing: a vacuum cleaner picks up dirt; a refrigerator
      keeps food cold, etc.</p>

      <p>Many machines can accept simple instructions. We can set the
      thermostat to tell the refrigerator how cold to keep the food. We step
      on the gas pedal to make a car move faster. We can even control how
      much a hammer moves a nail by adjusting how hard we swing our arm.</p>

      <p>Computers are a special kind of machine designed so that we can
      control them much more. We can give a computer a long set of
      instructions, and we can even ask it to make
      decisions.</p>

      <p><dfn>Programming</dfn> is the art of giving these
      instructions to a computer. Webol is a special program I've written to
      teach you how to program. It starts with a few simple steps and will
      add more and more, as you get more advanced.</p>

    <section><h1>Immediate Commands</h1>

      <p>The first thing we will in Webol is how to tell the computer to do
      something right now. This is called an <dfn>immediate
      command</dfn>. One such command, which we will learn very soon, is
      the <code>PRINT</code> command which tells the computer to write
      something.</p>

      <h2>The Webol console</h2>

      <p>But, first, we need to learn about the <dfn>Webol console</dfn>. You
      should open the console now, in a different window or tab, by going to
      <a href="http://webol.degel.com">the Webol web page</a>.</p>

      <p>This page includes several sections, most of which will only be
      important later on.</p>

      <p>For now, look for the section that says
      <code>"Cmd:"</code>. We call this part of the screen the <dfn>input
      line</dfn>. This is where you will type commands to the computer.</p>

      <p>The big box on top of this is called the <dfn>console</dfn>. It is
      where the computer will display its answers.</p>

      <h2>The <code>PRINT</code> Command</h2>

      <p>The first command we will learn is the <code>PRINT</code>
      command. This tells the computer to "say" something. We can tell it to
      print a number, or a message. We can even solve arithmetic.</p>

      <p>To give a command, you need to type it, followed by
      the <code>enter</code> key. Each time you do this, the computer will
      repeat your command in the console, and then show its answer.</p>

      <p>Try the following:</p>

      <p><kbd>PRINT "Hello"</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT 3</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT 3+7</kbd></p>
      <p><kbd>PRINT "3+7"</kbd></p>

      <p class="question">Question: What did the computer answer to each of these commands?
      What was different about the last two commands?  What do you think the
      quotation mark means in your command?</p>

      <p class="question">Question: what do you think will happen if
      type <kbd>PRINT hello</kbd> to the computer? Try it now.</p>

    <section><h1>Immediate Commands</h1>

      <p>The first thing we will in Webol is how to tell the computer to do
      something right now. This is called an <dfn>immediate mode</dfn>
      commands. One such command, which we will learn very soon, is
      the <code>PRINT</code> command which tells the computer to write
      something.</p>

      <aside>Note: In this manual, I'm writing all the commands
      in <code>UPPERCASE</code>. But, when you use Webol, you can write
      commands however you want:
      in <code>UPPERCASE</code>, <code>lowercase</code> or
      even <code>sILlycASe</code>.</aside>

      <h2>The Webol console</h2>

      <p>But, first, we need to learn about the <dfn>Webol console</dfn>. You
      should open the console now, in a different window or tab, by going to
      <a href="http://webol.degel.com">the Webol web page</a>.</p>

      <p>This page includes several sections, most of which will only be
      important later on.</p>

      <p>For now, look for the section that says
      <code>"Cmd:"</code>. We call this part of the screen the <dfn>input
      line</dfn>. This is where you will type commands to the computer.</p>

      <p>The big box on top of this is called the <dfn>console</dfn>. It is
      where the computer will display its answers.</p>

      <h2>The <code>PRINT</code> Command</h2>

      <p>The first command we will learn is the <code>PRINT</code>
      command. This tells the computer to "say" something. We can tell it to
      print a number, or a message. We can even solve arithmetic.</p>

      <p>To give a command, you need to type it, followed by
      the <code>enter</code> key. Each time you do this, the computer will
      repeat your command in the console, and then show its answer.</p>

      <p>Try the following:</p>

      <p><blockquote>PRINT "Hello"</blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote>PRINT 3</blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote>PRINT 3+7</blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote>PRINT "3+7"</blockquote></p>

      <p class="question">Question: What did the computer answer to each of
      these commands?  What was different about the last two commands?  What
      do you think the quotation marks mean in the print commmand?</p>

      <p class="question">Question: what do you think will happen if
      type <kbd>PRINT hello</kbd> to the computer? Try it now.</p>

    </section>

    <section><h1>Run Mode</h1>

      <p>In immediate mode, the computer does exactly what you ask, and does
      it immediately. This is very nice if you want to use the computer as a
      calculator, but sometimes you want to do more: You want to give the
      computer a set of instructions for it to run later on, or maybe to run
      many times.</p>

      <p>To do this, you need to write a <dfn>program</dfn>. There are many,
      many different programming languages. Some were designed to make
      certain jobs easier. Others were designed for teaching. Still others
      were created because ... well, I don't know; people just like
      inventing new things.</p>

      <p>Webol uses a small programming language that I have designed for
      teaching students. It is very similar to the first language I learned,
      called BASIC, which was created at Dartmouth University almost fifty
      years ago.</p>

      <h2>Line numbers</h2>

      <p>In Webol, you create a program by writing commands that start with
      a <dfn>line number</dfn>. Here is a simple program:</p>

      <blockquote>
	1 PRINT "Hello!"<br>
	2 PRINT "My name is Webby."<br>
	3 PRINT "I am a program."<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Try typing that program into the Webol console. Notice that the
      computer echoes each line back to you, but does not actually run the
      line. You have now written a program: a set of instructions that the
      computer can follow.</p>

      <h2>Commands that manage programs</h2>

      <h3>The <code>LIST</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>LIST</code> command tells the computer to show us the
      whole program.</p>

      <p>Try it now:<br>
      <blockquote>LIST</blockquote></p>

      <h3>The <code>RUN</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>RUN</code> command tells the computer to run the
      program. It will look for all the instructions we gave, and will run
      them, in the order of the line numbers.</p>

      <h3>The <code>CLEAR</code> command</H3>

      <p>The <code>CLEAR</code> command tells the computer to forget all the
      lines that we taught it. After you say <kbd>CLEAR</kbd>, the computer
      will not have a program to run until you give it a new program.</p>

      </section>

      <section><h1>Program flow</h1>

      <p><dfn>Program flow</dfn> means the order in which the computer
      follows instructions. Like we saw above, normally Webol starts with
      the lowest line number, and runs each instruction exactly once. This
      lets us do many things. For example:

      <p class="question">Write a program that counts from one to five. (You
      should be able to write this program in just five instructions).</p>

      <p class="question">Run the program to make sure that it works.</p>

      <p>Soon, we will learn two new commands, <code>GOTO</code>
      and <code>IF</code>, that will let us write programs that are much
      more interesting. But first we need to learn about variables.</p>

      <h2>Variables</h2>

      <p>Variables are one of the most important parts of any program. They
      are a very important concept and you need to understand exactly what
      they do.</p>

      <p>You can think of a variable as being a little box that is just big
      enough to hold one number. Each variable in your program has a name
      (like the name of the box) and a value (the number that is held in the
      box).</p>

      <h3><code>DIM</code> to create a variable</h3>

      <p>A new program begins with no variables. You need to register the
      variables you want to use. You do this with the <code>DIM</code>
      command. This command creates a new variable, gives it a name, and
      puts the value 0 into it. Sounds complicated, but it is really quite
      easy.</p>

      <p>Create a variable named <code>x</code>:<br>
      <blockquote>
	10 DIM x
      </blockquote></p>

      <p>Create three variables named <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>:<br>
      <blockquote>
	10 DIM a, b, c
      </blockquote></p>

      <p>Create a variable with a long name <code>ThisIsMyVariable</code>:<br>
      <blockquote>
	 10 DIM ThisIsMyVariable
      </blockquote></p>

      <h3><code>LET</code> to change a variable</h3>

      <p>Ok, so now we know how to create a variable, and store a zero in
      it. How can we store other numbers? Very easy; we use
      the <code>LET</code> command. This command takes a variable name, and
      a value to put into it.</p>

      <p>Create <code>x</code> and give it the value 17:<br>
      <blockquote>
      10 DIM x<br>
      20 LET x = 17
      </blockquote>

      <p>Create variable <code>sum</code> and give it the total of adding a
      few numbers:<br>
      <blockquote>
      10 DIM sum<br>
      20 LET sum = 1+2+3+4+5
      </blockquote>

      <p>You can also change the value of a variable and even use variables
      to create values for other variables:</p>
      <blockquote>
      1 DIM x,y<br>
      2 LET x = 1<br>
      3 PRINT "X=", x<br>
      4 LET y = x+1<br>
      5 PRINT "Y=", y<br>
      6 LET x = (x+y)/100<br>
      7 PRINT "Now x=", x<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="question">Can you predict what that program will print?
      Write it down, and now try to run the program. Were you right?</p>

      <aside>That example showed us another new thing too. You can print
      several things at the same time, by putting a comma between them. This
      is useful when you want to print more information on one line.</aside>

      <h3>String variables</h3>

      <p>In programming, a <dfn>string</dfn> is what we call a piece of
      text. We write a string by putting it inside quotation marks. You've
      seen examples of strings already in some programs. We've used strings
      like "Hello" and "X=".</p>

      <p>We can also put strings into variables, just like we did with numbers:</p>
      <blockquote>
      10 DIM name<br>
      20 LET name = "Alfred"<br>
      30 PRINT "Hello", name
      </blockquote>

      <p class="question">What does that program do? Can you write a program
      that will say hello to YOU?</p>

      <p class="question">Now that you've learned about strings and about
      variables, can you answer the question we asked way back at the
      beginning? Why did <kbd>PRINT "Hello"</kbd> work, but not <kbd>PRINT
      Hello</kbd>?</p>

      <h2>Controlling program flow</h2>

      <h3>The <code>GOTO</code> command</H3>

      <p>Until now, in every example we've seen, saying <kbd>RUN</kbd> has
      caused each line of our program to run exactly one time, and always in
      number order. The <code>GOTO</code> command makes things more
      interesting by telling the program what line to run next..</p>

      <p class="warning">WARNING: Look at the next program but <em>do not run
      it</em>. It will do bad things. So, read further first.</p>

      <p>This program creates what we call an <dfn>infinite loop</dfn>, a
      program that runs forever and never stops.</p>
      <blockquote>
      10 PRINT "Here I am!"<br>
      20 GOTO 10<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Real computers usually have ways to stop this kind of loop. But,
      Webol does not have a good way yet. The only way to stop the program
      is to press the browser's refresh button (the button that looks
      like <img src="art/refresh-button.png">
      or <img src="art/chrome-reload-button.png">). This will also erase
      your program and reload all of Webol.

      <p class="question">Try it now. Type in the two-line program and
      say <kbd>RUN</kbd>. When you have seen what it does, use the browser
      refresh button to stop it and clear the program.</p>

      <p>You already know how to write a program that counts to 5:</p>

      <blockquote>
      10 PRINT 1<br>
      20 PRINT 2<br>
      30 PRINT 3<br>
      40 PRINT 4<br>
      50 PRINT 5<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p>You now can also write a program that counts forever:</p>

      <blockquote>
      10 DIM count<br>
      20 LET count=1<br>
      30 PRINT COUNT<br>
      40 LET count=count+1<br>
      50 GOTO 30<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="question">Read that program. Can you understand what it
      does?</p>

      <p class="question">We are going to run this program a few times. But,
      it contains an infinite loop. So, let's save it first so that Webol
      reloads it automatically everytime we refresh the page. So, after you
      enter the program, push the <kbd>Save</kbd> button at the top of the
      page.</p>

      <p class="question">Now run the program and watch it count. When
      you've seen enough, push refresh to stop it.</p>

      <p class="question">What do you think would happen if we changed the
      program so that line 50 said <kbd>GOTO 20</kbd>? How about if we
      changed it to be <kbd>GOTO 40</kbd>?  Try both of these changes and
      see if you guessed right.</p>

       <aside>Remember that you don't need to type the whole program again
      just to change one line; you can change any line of your program just
      by typing that line again.</aside>

      <p><aside>Also, you may have wondered why we often number the lines 10,
      20, 30, etc., and not just 1, 2, 3...  This is to make it easier to
      make changes later on. If you later write a line 25, it will run
      between lines 20 and 30. This makes it easier to make changes to your
      programs.</aside></p>

      <h3>The <code>IF</code> command</H3>

      <p>So, we know how to get the program to count to 5 or to count
      forever. But, what if we want to count to 50? Would we have to write
      a 50 line proram?  NO! The very powerful <code>IF</code> command
      gives us a neat way to do this.

      <p class="question">What do you think this program will do? Try
      it.</p>

      <blockquote>
      10 DIM count<br>
      20 LET count = 1<br>
      30 PRINT COUNT<br>
      40 LET count = count+1<br>
      50 IF count <= 50 THEN GOTO 30<br>
      </blockquote>

      <p>You've now learned enough about programming to write some simple,
      but very real, programs. You've learned:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A program contains a set of instructions that the computer will
	follow exactly.</li>
	<li>You can print numbers with the <code>PRINT</code> command.</li>
	<li>You can make and change variables with the <code>DIM</code>
	and <code>LET</code>.</li>
	<li>You can control program flow with the <code>GOTO</code>
	and <code>IF</code> commands.
      </ul>

      <p>Now, you can write some programs by yourself. Here are some
      ideas:</p>

      <p class=question>Write a program to print all the odd numbers less
      than 30.</p>

      <p class=question>Write a program to print the <dfn>triangle
      numbers</dfn>. These are the numbers that are the solutions to the
      equations: 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4, etc. So, the first numbers printed
      should be 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.</p>

      <p class=question>Write a program to print the <dfn>fibonacci
      series</dfn>. This is the series of numbers you get if you start with
      0 and 1, and each next number is the sum of the previous two. So, the
      series starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  (2 is 1+1; 3 is 1+2; 5 is
      2+3; etc.)</p>

      <p class=question>Invent your own programs. Have fun.</p>

      <section><h1>Next Steps</h1>

      <p>I will write the next chapter soon, but first I need to add more
      features to Webol.</p>
